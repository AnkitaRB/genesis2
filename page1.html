                  Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows
                  by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly
                  into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however
                  a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do 
                  so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She 
                  packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic

Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.

The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.
